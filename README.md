# Starter React App

This is a template repo for a quick react app. Doesn't contain anything fancy,
just a setup for quickly developing a React app with Typescript that can deploy to github pages.

Currently set up with the following:

- `react`
- `typescript`
- `scss`
- `vite`

And a few other supporting packages.

## Run the project

```
 npm run dev
```

Then go to `localhost:3000`
