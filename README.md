# Webpack React App

This is a template repo for a webpack based react app. Doesn't contain anything fancy,
just a setup for quickly developing in react with Typescript that can deploy to github pages.

Currently set up with the following:

- `react` 17.0.1
- `webpack` 5.24.4
- `typescript` 4.2.3
- `eslint` 7.21.0

And a few other supporting packages
